# Welcome to the Solar Car Challenge

## Getting Started

If you are not familiar with GitHub, the [intro to GitHub](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/) is a very useful tool.

GitHub offers an excellent free student pack with tons of useful products and services [available here](https://education.github.com/pack)

## About this site

GitHub is a collaborative site.  Here you can find examples of code that you can borrow (fork) to help develop your own ideas.  You can also contribute (pull request) to other people's projects help them create a better product.

The Solar Car Challenge staff have developed some applications to assist your race effort.  You can use them as is, or customize them to your specific needs.  You can also contribute your own applications to help improve the race.

## Applications
1. pi-top program - This program runs on the pi-top.  It receives the data from the car, stores it, and displays it to the user.
2. HELIOS program - This is the arduino code and supporting documents for the pi-top HELIOS boards.
3. Radio program - there are two Arduino programs in this folder that create the radio bridge if you are attempting a DIY project.  One for the car side that collects and transmits the information and one for the pi-top which receives the information and feed it to the pi-top.

## Helpful Spreadsheets

1. Carsetup.ods - This spreadsheet tracks the setup and prepration of the solar car.  It has a simple solution for measruing and calculating fron end alignment.  It can also be used to track usage and trends on the solar car.



Please fork our project and customize it to your needs.  If you have problems or questions, you can submit and track them on the issues tab.  If you think you can make our products better, please submit a pull request.
