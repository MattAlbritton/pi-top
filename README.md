# Welcome to the Solar Car Challenge

## Getting Started

If you are not framiliar with GitHub, the [intro to GitHub](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/) is a very useful tool.

GitHub offers an excellent free student pack with tons of useful products and services [available here](https://education.github.com/pack)

## About this site

GitHub is a collaborative site.  Here you can find examples of code that you can borrow (fork) to help develop your own ideas.  You can also contribute (pull request) to other people's projects help them create a better product.

The Solar Car Challenge staff have developed some applications to assist your race effort.  You can use them as is, or customize them to your specific needs.  You can also contribute your own applications to help improve the race.

## Applications
1. Telemetry TX - This is the program loaded on the Arduino that collects telemetry in the solar car and transimits it to the pi-top.
2. Telemetry RX - This program runs on the pi-top.  It recieves the data from the car, stores it, and displays it to the user.



Please fork our project and customize it to your needs.  If you have problems or questions, you can submit and track them on the issues tab.  If you think you can make our products better, please submit a pull request.
