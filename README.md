## About this site

GitHub is a collaberative site.  Here you can find examples of code that you can borrow (fork) to help develop your own idea.  You can also contribute (pull request) to other peoples projects help them create a better product.

The Solar Car Challenge staff have developed some applications to assist.  You can use them as is, or customize them to your specific needs.  You can also contribute your own applications to help improve the race.

## Applications
1. Telemetry TX - This is the program loaded on the arduino that collects telemetry in the solar car and transimits it to the pi-top
2. Telemetry RX - This program runs on the pi-top.  It recieves the data from the car, stores it, and displays it to the user.
